## Purpose:

Do a bike trip analysis in Des Moines. We used Tableau to create visualizations to 

-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.

-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
